/*
** This function:
** ^C is printed by the terminal itself (ECHOCTL), not by your handle_sigint.
	To make minishell behave like bash (no ^C shown), you must disable ECHOCTL 
	on the terminal.
Reads current terminal settings.
Turns off the ECHOCTL flag so the kernel stops printing ^C.
Applies the new settings.
No ternary operator is used.
Press Ctrl-C at the prompt.
You should now see only a new line and a fresh
 minishell> prompt, with no ^C, just like bash.
